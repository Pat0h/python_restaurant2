Object Relationship Methods
Use SQLAlchemy query methods where appropriate.
Review
- `Review customer()`
  - should return the `Customer` instance for this review
- `Review restaurant()`
  - should return the `Restaurant` instance for this review
 

Restaurant
- `Restaurant reviews()`
  - returns a collection of all the reviews for the `Restaurant`
- `Restaurant customers()`
  - returns a collection of all the customers who reviewed the `Restaurant`
 

Customer
- `Customer reviews()`
  - should return a collection of all the reviews that the `Customer` has left
- `Customer restaurants()`
  - should return a collection of all the restaurants that the `Customer` has reviewed
 

You can create a `debug.py` file and use it to check that these methods work before proceeding.
For example, you should be able to call `session.query(Customer).first().restaurants` and see a list of the restaurants for the first customer in the database based on your seed data; and `session.query(Review).first().customer` should return the customer for the first review in the database.
